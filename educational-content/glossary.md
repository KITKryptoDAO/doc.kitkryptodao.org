### Chainlink CCIP
Chainlink CCIP provides a single simple interface through which dApps and web3 entrepreneurs can securely meet all their cross-chain needs. You can use CCIP to transfer data, tokens, or both data and tokens across chains. Given the inherent risks of cross-chain interoperability, CCIP is built with a security-first mindset. Some security features include a Risk Management Network that monitors for malicious activity, decentralized oracle computation from a wide range of high-quality node operators with verifiable on-chain performance histories, and the off-chain reporting (OCR) protocol, which already secures significant value on several mainnet blockchains.

### Chainlink Data Feeds
Chainlink Data Feeds are the quickest way to connect your smart contracts to the real-world data such as asset prices, reserve balances, NFT floor prices, and L2 sequencer health.

### Chainlink Data Streams
Chainlink Data Streams provides low-latency delivery of market data off-chain that you can verify onchain. With Chainlink Data Streams, decentralized applications (dApps) now have on-demand access to high-frequency market data backed by decentralized and transparent infrastructure. When combined with Chainlink Automation, Data Streams allows decentralized applications to automate trade execution and mitigate frontrunning.

### Chainlink VRF
Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security or usability.

### Chainlink Proof of Reserves
Proof of Reserves (PoR) verifies digital asset collateralization held by crypto businesses, helping bring greater transparency to depositors via public attestations and independent audits.

### Chainlink Automation
Automate your smart contracts using a secure and hyper-reliable decentralized network that uses the same external network of node operators that secures billions in value. Building on Chainlink Automation will accelerate your innovation, save you time and money, and help you get to market faster so you don't have to deal with the setup cost, ongoing maintenance, and risks associated with a centralized automation stack.

### Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) Protocol
The OCR protocol allows nodes to aggregate their observations into a single report off-chain using a secure P2P network. A single node then submits a transaction with the aggregated report to the chain. Each report consists of many nodes' observations and has to be signed by a quorum of nodes. These signatures are verified on-chain.

### InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)
The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a set of composable, peer-to-peer protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring content-addressed data in a decentralized file system.

### Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)
A DAO is a collectively-owned, blockchain-governed organization working towards a shared mission. DAOs allow us to work with like-minded folks around the globe without trusting a benevolent leader to manage the funds or operations. There is no CEO who can spend funds on a whim or CFO who can manipulate the books. Instead, blockchain-based rules baked into the code define how the organization works and how funds are spent. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice, and everything happens transparently on-chain.
